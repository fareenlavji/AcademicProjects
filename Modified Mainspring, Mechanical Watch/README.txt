For an end of term project, I presented my team with the idea to reverse engineer the mainspring of a mechanical watch to increase lifespan.
The team came up with a solution which was to create a gradual ball and socket mechanism to decelerate elasticity.
Personal tasks involved working on long term report and assisting other team members in creating the 3D model and researching measurements required to implement the ball and socket system
